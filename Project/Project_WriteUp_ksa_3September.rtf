Can I predict how many months it has taken (or will take) for any county in the US to return to within 1% of its pre-recession unemployment rate (average rate in 2007)? i.e. What types of counties are successful in America\'92s post recession economy?\
\
As of  2014 only 15% of counties in the United States had returned their pre-recession unemployment rate, while only 56% percent had returned to within 1% of pre-recession unemployment. Over 30% of counties still saw unemployment over 2% higher than the average rate for 2007. \
\
I plan to use demographic, socioeconomic, education, industrial dependence, governance, local economic indicators, and hopefully a geographic analytic that takes into account counties spatial neighbors. See data list below for more explanation. My hypothesis is that rural communities with less  education, less capital as measured in household wealth, and who received less federal stimulus will take much longer to recover than other counties. \
\
I chose this topic as it is an extension of my undergraduate senior research in the fall of 2008 which tired tried to explore how different types of counties (rural, suburban, and urban) would be affected by the then ongoing recession. I used previous recessions to show that rural counties lagged behind urban ones, though the data was incomplete for previous recessions beyond the early 2000s. As we now have data that could help explore and predict recovery, I think it is a worthwhile topic to revisit. \
\
As a learning experience I wanted to chose a project that incorporates spatial and temporal data and answers a broad question with more data than I would want to use in excel. \
\
\
Data slightly more in depth:\
\
Demographic: from census bureau \'97> % under 18, % 25-64, % over 65, ethnicity/race, \
Socioeconomic: poverty rate, median income, (census) (raw, % change 2007 to 2014), maybe more?\
Rural v. Suburban v. Urban\
Education categories (census) (raw, % change 2007 to 2014)\
Net Migration  To/From in 10 years before, since 2009 (census)\
Industry (USDA Binary 2004 county typology codes farming/mining/service/government dependent)\
Neighborhood effects (want to take into account each county\'92s US neighbors) for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics\
Governance (republican v democratic legislature in 2008/2009?), ($$ in state stimulus?), (change in tax rates?)\
